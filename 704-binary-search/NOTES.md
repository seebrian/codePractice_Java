â€‹Basic Binary Search
Note:
1. Range: [left, right]
- while loop condition: if (left<=right), because right is inclusive 
- if ( arr[mid] > target) right = mid + 1, because +1 ensure program did not search before
- if ( target < arr[mid]) left = mid + 1, because +1 ensure program did not search before
- right = arr size -1, because start from 0 index to arr size -1 index

2. Range: [left, right)
- while loop condition: if (left<ight), because right is not inclusive 
- if ( arr[mid] > target) right = mid , because +1 ensure program did not search before
- if ( target < arr[mid]) left = mid + 1, because +1 ensure program did not search before
- right = arr size
